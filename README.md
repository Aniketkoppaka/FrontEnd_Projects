# üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of frontend projects!  
This repository includes all the hands-on frontend projects I've built while taking [Angela Yu‚Äôs Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) and also a few personal experiments and creative builds.

## üöÄ About

These projects helped me strengthen my skills in:
- HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox & Grid
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- DOM Manipulation
- Responsive Web Design
- Bootstrap
- Frontend best practices

Each project is self-contained and demonstrates a specific concept or feature in frontend development.
